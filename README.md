A Digital Random Bit Generator

As an ergodic process, MKRAND produces a statistically homogenous random bitstream. This bitstream is rendered in various formats.


**Updates since TA-1:**
* Streaming, use -n 0
* Profiler now calculates entropy (H)
  
Note - Format 0 file output broken, see issues.
